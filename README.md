# synesthesia-v0

A music visualiser created using p5.js, and html, and vanilla css.
> I will only create a link to this version of the project after it is successfully migrated to [React.js](https://react.dev/).
> This version is my first draft of the visualiser.

## Resources used
- [The Aesthetic Programming Handbook](https://aesthetic-programming.net/)
- 3d Cartesian Planes on youtube.
- A lot of inspiration.

## Future Development
- Migration to React.js
- Addition of a user input audio button
- Some extra lerping color motion
- And moving text.

## General Notes
> I have a lot to say about the migration process, particularly the p5.js library addon problem with React.js. I've been here for days.
